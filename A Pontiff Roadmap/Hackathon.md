The Vibe
This hackathon is deliberately experimental. We want agents that are weird, powerful, and push boundaries. We want to see what happens when you give AI agents a high-performance blockchain as their coordination layer.

The thesis is simple: Agents need money rails and the ability to transact at scale. Monad gives them that. Nad.fun lets them build communities and monetize. You make it happen.

Two Ways to Win
Choose your path. Both tracks reward excellence in agent development.

Agent+Token Track
$140K

Build autonomous agents on Monad and launch their token on nad.fun.
Building in public is the meta for this track:
attention → community conviction → token success.
Turn creator fees into the first real agent economy.

Perfect if you:

Your agent does cool stuff (trades, coordinates, manages, whatever)
You launch a token for it on nad.fun
Community can speculate on your agent's success
Token can be for governance, rev share, access rights—get creative
Prizes

10 Open Winners
$10K each = $100K cash
Liquidity Boost
$40K AUSD
Highest market cap (difference) token on nad.fun at the end wins liquidity boost

Agent Track
$60K

Same types of agents, same Monad integration, but skip the token launch. Pure builder mode.

Perfect if you:

Focus on making the agent good
Crypto-curious but not ready to launch
Prizes

3 Open Winners
$10K each = $30K
3 Bounty Winners
$10K each = $30K

FAQ
Got questions? We've got answers.

Do I need crypto experience?
No! Choose the Agent Track if you're new to blockchain. You'll only need basic Monad integration for logging or coordination.

Can I submit to both tracks?
Yes, but projects must be substantially different.

When will I know if I won?
We will contact you prior to the announcement.

How many winners total?
Up to 16 winners ($10K each) + 1 liquidity boost winner ($40K). If quality threshold isn't met, funds distributed to top performers.

Do I need a team?
No! Solo developers and teams are both welcome.

Can I use existing code?
Yes, but clearly document what's original vs. what's reused. The innovation must be substantial and meet track requirements.

Why rolling judging?
The agent narrative is HOT right now. Rolling winners get maximum exposure during peak market interest, and early excellence gets rewarded with extended visibility.

Ready to Build?
The agent narrative is peaking. Build something that trades, coordinates, or does something entirely new. Ship early, win early.
